/* ------------------------------------

 * Project:	OAC 4.0
 *
 * Task:	To provide a static method that can take a string, interpret
 *		the values within it as dates, and generate a list of decades
 *		that span those dates.
 *
 * Name:	FacetDecade
 *
 * Command line parameters:  (when invoked from the command line, so that
 *		the "static void main" method is invoked)
 *		any number of parameters, each is passed to the static
 *		facet decade method one at a time.
